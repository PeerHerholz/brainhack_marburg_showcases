### What's happening?

Ahoi hoi everyone,

are you doing/planning to do a lot of computational work, specifically programming and are wondering how to best approach this in an open, reproducible and FAIR manner? Then this repository and the included materials might be of interest to you. In more detail, we will introduce and talk about two amazing things here: [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) & the [python programming language](https://www.python.org/). The first is an amazing resource/framework for basically anything related to computational work (`running code`, `documenting analyses`, `conducting lectures/tutorials`, etc.) and the second entails nothing less but the "second-best-for-everything" `programming language` that is completely `open-source`, `highly interoperable` and has `modules/libraries` for literally everything you want to do. As this showcase is conducted during the [BrainHack Global](https://brainhack.org/global2022/), specifically the [Marburg Hub](https://brainhack-marburg.github.io/), a lot of the content is tailored towards `neuroscience`. However, most other fields of `research` and `applications` are equally supported (JFYI). 
### What's in here?

In this repository we created small showcases that aim to introduce [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) as holistically as possible and set it up in a way that you can run/explore it via the awesome [binder service](https://mybinder.org/), i.e. a free service that turns your repository into a [Docker image](https://docs.docker.com/) which is then hosted on a [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) that allows to work with your [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) interactively. To get to this mysterious interactive instance, you just have to click this button:

To make everything a bit more relatable to [Brainhacks](https://brainhack.org/global2022/), ie `neuroscience`, the examples will showcase respective applications.
The files in more detail:

- [data/environment.yml]() - a text file that indicates all [python](https://www.python.org/) modules/libraries we need for the example
- [jupyter-notebooks.ipynb]() - a `jupyter notebook` aiming to introduce `jupyter notebooks` (it's `jupyter notebook-ception`)
- [python_intro.ipynb]() - a `jupyter notebook` aiming to introduce core aspects of the [python programming language](https://www.python.org/)

### I have a question/How can I get help?

No biggie at all. We are happy to answer all questions you might have and help solve problems you might face when running this resource. Please just open an [issue here]() and we will get back to you asap!

### I found a :bug:

First of all: are you sure it's not a feature? JK, that's great and we would appreciate you reporting it via an [issue](). If you are up for it and want to submit a [PR]() to fix it, even better. If you don't have experience with that, no worries, we will help you to get there!
