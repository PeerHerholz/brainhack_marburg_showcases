    "Next up: `list`s. In general, `list`s are very similar to `strings`. One crucial difference is that `list` elements (things in the `list`) can be of any `type`: `integers`, `floats`, `strings`, etc. . Additionally, `types` can be freely mixed within a `list`, that is, each `element` of a list can be of a different `type`. `List`s are among the `data types` and `structures` you'll work with almost every time you do something in `python`. They are super handy and comparably to `strings`, have a lot of \"in-built\" functionality.\n",
